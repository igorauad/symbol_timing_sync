function [ normTauE, g ] = simSCurve(TED, rollOff, rcDelay, nSymbols)
%% Compute the S-Curve for the data-aided TED operation
%
% Simulates the average error detected by a TED of choice for varying
% receiver timing offsets. The simulation sends a number of random 2-PAM
% symbols over the cascaded combination of the Tx and matched filters. Each
% transmitted symbol produces a timing error detection out of the TED, and
% the average of these detected errors becomes the S-curve value for that
% timing offset. This process repeats for all simulated timing offsets.
%
% [ normTauE, g ] = simSCurve(TED, rollOff, rcDelay, nSymbols) returns the
% S-curve g(normTauE) of the chosen TED obtained through simulation. It
% also returns the vector normTauE with the normalized time offset errors
% (within -0.5 to 0.5) where the S-curve is evaluated.
%    TED -> TED choice.
%    rollOff -> Rolloff factor.
%    rcDelay -> Raised cosine pulse delay (default: 10).
%    nSymbols -> Number of random 2-PAM symbols to simulate (default: 1e4).

% Oversampling (use a large value to observe the S-curve with enough
% resolution). Note the oversampling factor that is effectively used on a
% symbol timing recovery loop has nothing to do with the factor adopted
% here. Here, the only goal is to observe the S curve, and the S curve (a
% continuous time metric) should be independent of the oversampling factor.

% is as follows: suppose we are simulating the receiver signalling the
% strobe L/2 sample intervals earlier (before the ideal strobe location).
% In that case, the tauEst is "-L/2" (negative). However, the difference
% "tau - tauEst" is "+L/2" (positive).
