% Symbol Timing Loop
% ---------------------
%
% Implements closed-loop symbol timing recovery with a configurable timing
% error detector (TED) and a configurable interpolator. The feedback
% control loop uses a proportional-plus-integrator (PI) controller and a
% modulo-1 counter to control the interpolator. Meanwhile, the TED can be
% configured from five alternative implementations:
%     - Maximum-likelihood TED (MLTED);
%     - Early-late TED (ELTED);
%     - Zero-crossing TED (ZCTED);
%     - Gardner TED (GTED);
%     - Mueller-Muller TED (MMTED).
% The interpolator can be chosen from four implementations:
%     - Polyphase;
%     - Linear;
%     - Quadratic;
%     - Cubic.
%
% When using a polyphase interpolator, the loop simultaneously synchronizes
% the symbol timing and implements the matched filter (MF). In this case,
% the loop processes the MF input sequence directly, and there is no need
% for an external MF block. In contrast, when using any other interpolation
% method (linear, quadratic, or cubic), the loop processes the MF output
% and produces interpolated values based on groups of MF output samples.
% For instance, the linear interpolator projects a line between a pair of
% MF output samples and produces an interpolant along this line. Thus, when
% using the linear, quadratic, or cubic interpolators, this symbol
% synchronizer loop must be preceded by a dedicated MF block.
%
% In any case, to support both pre-MF and post-MF interpolation approaches,
% this function takes both the MF input and MF output sequences as input
% arguments (i.e., the mfIn and mfOut arguments). The mfOut argument can be
% empty when using the polyphase interpolator, while the mfIn argument can
% be empty when using the other interpolation methods. The only exception
% is if using the MLTED. The MLTED uses the so-called derivative matched
% filter (dMF), which takes the MF input sequence and produces the
% differentiated MF output. Thus, when using the MLTED, even with the
% linear, quadratic, or cubic interpolators, the MF input sequence must be
% provided on the "mfIn" input argument.
%
% Note the reason why the matched filtering is executed jointly with symbol
% synchronization when using the polyphase interpolator is merely because
% it is possible to do so. The cascaded combination of the Tx root raised
% cosine (RRC) filter and the matched RRC filter results in a raised cosine
% filter, which, in turn, is an Lth-band filter (also known as Nyquist
% filter) that is adequate for interpolation (see [2]). Hence, the two
% tasks (interpolation and matched filtering) can be achieved in one go,
% which saves the need and computational cost of an extra dedicated MF
% block. If it were not for this approach, the computational cost of the
% polyphase interpolator would typically be higher than the other
% interpolation methods. In contrast, by using the polyphase interpolator
% jointly as the MF, its computational cost becomes nearly zero, since it
% only implements the indispensable MF computations.
%
% Furthermore, note all TED schemes except the GTED compute the symbol
% timing error using symbol decisions. Hence, the reference constellation
% and scaling factor must be provided through input arguments 'const' and
% 'Ksym'. Such TED schemes could also leverage prior knowledge and compute
% the timing error using known symbols instead of decisions. However, this
% function does not offer the data-aided alternative. Instead, it only
% implements the decision-directed flavor of each TED. Meanwhile, the
% GTED is the only scheme purely based on the raw input samples, which is
% not decision-directed nor data-aided. Hence, the 'const' and 'Ksym'
% arguments are irrelevant when using the GTED.

%% Derivative Matched Filter (dMF) - used with the MLTED only
% As explained above, the polyphase interpolator implements the matched
% filtering concurrently with interpolation, so there is no need for a
% dedicated MF block. When using the polyphase interpolator with an MLTED,
% the same applies for the dMF part. Namely, an additional polyphase filter
% is adopted just for the differential matched filtering. The polyphase dMF
% obtains the interpolants jointly with dMF filtering, so there is no need
% to use a dedicated dMF block. In contrast, the other interpolators
% require a dedicated dMF block and process the dMF output directly. For
% such interpolators, implement the dedicated dMF block right here:
if (intpl ~= 0 && strcmp(TED, 'MLTED'))
    mf = rcosdesign(rollOff, rcDelay, L);
    dmf = derivativeMf(mf, L);
    dMfOut = filter(dmf, 1, mfIn);

%% Interpolator Design

% Polyphase filter bank
if (intpl == 0)
    % Interpolation factor
    %
    % Note the polyphase filter's interpolation factor is completely
    % independent from the receiver's oversampling factor L. For instance,
    % the receiver may be running with L=2 and the polyphase filter may
    % still apply a significantly higher interpolation factor. Furthermore,
    % note that there is no performance penalty in using a high
    % interpolation factor, aside from using more memory to store the
    % polyphase filter bank. In the end, a single subfilter is used per
    % strobe anyway. A high interpolation factor (e.g., 128) is preferable
    % when the receiver oversampling is low (e.g., L=2).
    polyInterpFactor = 128;

    % Polyphase MF realization
    %
    % Note the RRC filter is not an Lth-band filter, so it is not strictly
    % adequate for a polyphase interpolation filter. However, its cascaded
    % combination with the RRC filter used on the Tx side for pulse shaping
    % yields a raised cosine filter, which is a proper Lth-band filter.
    %
    % The RRC filter is normally designed based on the receiver's
    % oversampling factor L. However, the following RRC is also an
    % interpolator, and the interpolator aims to "divide" each sampling
    % period into polyInterpFactor instants (or phases). Hence, design the
    % filter with a combined oversampling factor of "L * polyInterpFactor".
    % Later on, after applying the polyphase decomposition, each resulting
    % subfilter will end up having an oversampling of only L.
    interpMf = sqrt(polyInterpFactor) * ...
        rcosdesign(rollOff, rcDelay, L * polyInterpFactor);
    polyMf = polyDecomp(interpMf, polyInterpFactor);

    % For convenience, add one more subfilter to facilitate the branch
    % choice when mu(k)=1.0. The polyphase branch picked for interpolation
    % is based on the expression "round(polyInterpFactor * mu(k)) + 1",
    % where mu(k) ranges within [0, 1]. Hence, the branch index computed
    % with mu=1 would be out of bounds if the polyphase filter only had
    % polyInterpFactor branches.
    %
    % Besides, note the phase required when mu=0 and mu=1 is the same
    % (i.e., phase 0 and 2*pi). The only difference is on the filter delay.
    % When mu=1, the k-th interpolant is closer to x[m_k + 1], whereas,
    % when mu=0, it is closer to x[m_k]. Hence, the subfilter used when
    % mu=1 must be a shifted-by-one version of the first subfilter, namely
    % the same subfilter but with a delay shorter by one sampling period.
    polyMf(polyInterpFactor + 1, :) = [polyMf(1, 2:end), 0];
    assert(size(polyMf, 1) == polyInterpFactor + 1);

    % Polyphase dMF
    %
    % Each subfilter of the polyphase MF is a phase-offset RRC on its own,
    % equivalent to a phase-offset version of the filter produced by
    % "rcosdesign(rollOff, rcDelay, L)". Correspondingly, to polyphase dMF
    % shall contain the differentiated rows of the polyphase MF.
    polyDMf = zeros(size(polyMf));
    for i = 1:size(polyDMf, 1)
        polyDMf(i, :) = derivativeMf(polyMf(i, :), L);
    end

    % To facilitate the convolution computation using inner products, flip
    % all subfilters (rows of polyMf and polyDMf) from left to right.

% Quadratic and cubic interpolators
%
% Define the matrix bl_i with the Farrow coefficients to multiply the
% samples surrounding the desired interpolant. Each column of b_mtx holds
% b_l(i) for a fixed l (exponent of mu(k) in 8.76) and for i (neighbor
% sample index) from -2 to 1. After the fliplr operations, the first column
% becomes the one associated with l=0 and the last with l=2. Each of those
% columns are filters to process the samples from x(mk-1) to x(mk+2), i.e.,
% the sample before the basepoint index (x(mk-1)), the sample at the
% basepoint index (x(mk)), and two samples ahead (x(mk+1) and x(mk+2)).
% Before the flipud, the first row of bl_i would have the taps for i=-2,
% which would multiply x(mk+2). For convenience, however, the flipping
% ensures the first row has the taps for i=+1, which multiply x(mk-1). This
% order facilitates the dot product used later.

%% Timing Recovery Loop

% Constants
nSamples = length(inVec);
nSymbols = ceil(nSamples / L);

% Preallocate
xI = zeros(nSymbols, 1); % Output interpolants
mu = zeros(nSymbols, 1); % Fractional symbol timing offset estimate
v  = zeros(nSamples, 1); % PI output
e  = zeros(nSamples, 1); % Error detected by the TED

% Initialize
k      = 0; % interpolant/symbol index
strobe = 0; % strobe signal
cnt    = 1; % modulo-1 counter
vi     = 0; % PI filter integrator

% NOTE: by starting cnt with value 1, the first strobe is asserted when
% "n=L+1" and takes effect on iteration "n=L+2", while setting the
% basepoint index to "m_k=L+1". Furthermore, because the counter step is
% "W=1/L" before the first strobe and "cnt=0" when the first strobe is
% asserted, the first fractional interval estimate from Eq. (8.89) is
% "mu=0". Consequently, the first interpolant tends to be closer (or equal
% to) the sample at the basepoint index m_k. In other words, the first
% interpolant is "x(L+1)". This is not strictly necessary, but is important
% to understand, e.g., when evaluating the loop in unit tests. Also, this
% strategy is useful to ensure there is enough "memory" when the time comes
% to compute the first interpolant, as the interpolation equations use
% samples from the past. Lastly, note "cnt=1" only in the first iteration.
% In all other iterations, it is always within [0, 1).

% End the loop with enough margin for the computations
%
% Do not process the last L samples when using the ELTED due to the
% look-ahead scheme used to compute the "early" interpolant. When using the
% quadratic or cubic interpolators (which use "x(m_k + 2)"), leave one
% extra sample in the end. In all other cases, process all samples.
if (strcmp(TED, 'ELTED'))
    n_end = nSamples - L;
elseif (intpl > 1)
    n_end = nSamples - 1;
else
    n_end = nSamples;
end

% Start with enough history samples for the interpolator.
%
% As mentioned earlier, the first strobe only takes effect on iteration
% "n=L+2", and the first basepoint index is "m_k=L+1". Hence, the first
% interpolation can access up to L samples from the past. This amount is
% generally sufficient for the linear, quadratic, and cubic interpolators,
% which at maximum access the sample preceding the basepoint index (in this
% case, index "n = m_k - 1 = L"). Thus, the loop can be started right from
% "n=1". Furthermore, this approach works even with the ZCTED, ELTED, and
% GTED schemes, which need to compute the zero-crossing (or late)
% interpolants. The zero-crossing interpolant is computed based on the
% basepoint index at "m_k - L/2", so the interpolator only uses up to index
% "m_k - L/2 - 1", which is guaranteed to be available for L >= 2. For
% instance, if L=2, the first basepoint index is "m_k=3", the zero-crossing
% basepoint index is 2, and the interpolator accesses index 1 to compute
% the zero-crossing interpolant.
%
% The only scenario where there may not be enough history samples for the
% interpolation is if using the polyphase interpolator. The sample history
% required by the polyphase interpolator depends on the filter length
% adopted on each polyphase branch. Say, if the polyphase branch filter has
% length N, it processes the samples from index "m_k - N + 1" to m_k. This
% range only works if "m_k - N + 1 >= 1", namely if "m_k >= N". And since
% the first basepoint index occurs after L iterations from the start, the
% loop must start at index "N - L". Furthermore, when using the ELTED,
% which computes the late interpolant using basepoint index "m_k - L/2",
% the starting index must be offset by another "L/2" samples.
